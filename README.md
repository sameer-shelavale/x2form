x2form
======

X2Form is a HTML Form Generator developed with a vision of enabling the developers and novice users to generate HTML forms very quickly. The aim of this project is to save valuable time of developers, which they spend mostly in developing forms and making changes in them.  There is almost no form generator which provide similar features, And yet what makes X2Form stand out is the ease with which the forms can be generated, populated, validated and rendered with/without custom templates.
